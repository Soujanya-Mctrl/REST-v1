# REST-v1
REST-v1 is a simple RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB using Mongoose. Created as part of my learning journey, it demonstrates how to connect a Node.js server to a MongoDB database, handle basic API requests, and structure a minimal backend for development and practice purposes.
